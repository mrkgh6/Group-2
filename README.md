# 2016 Presidential Primary Standings


This project uses The Huffington Post's Pollster API to show data from the 2016 presidential primaries.  The data for the leading candidates is then graphed.  The following tools were used:

  - [Pollster](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/api)

  - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/)

  - [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)

The graph shows that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden got 1st, 2nd, and 3rd respectively while Trump, Cruz, and Romney lead for the Republican vote.  The graph is updated every time someone opens up the file.
